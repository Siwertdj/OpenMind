  - question: 17
    answer:
    - What everyone is talking about right now.
    - Migration, immigrants and the alysum seeker problem.
    - I think when talking about seeking asylum because of danger I'm entirely open
      to it.
    - We need people from outside of the Netherlands, the economy would collapse
      otherwise.
    - 'But when people think the grass is greener on the other side of the mountain
      and contribute nothing to society I think a country like the Netherlands should
      say: "No, there is no place for you here".'
    - I speak up about discrimination within the police itself as well.
    - It is not a place where you expect it to happens and it shouldn't be allowed.
    trait:
    - A social issue I'm interested in is the migration, immigrant and asylum seeker
      problem.
